## Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is based on building a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
I tested various machine learning models for prediction in jupyter notebook and choosed the best model with higher accuracy. 

**Tools Used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc. libraries.
