## Titanic Survival Prediction

This project was based on building a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
I tested various machine learning models for prediction in jupyter notebook and choosed the best model with higher accuracy. 
While fitting the model I used pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, etc. libraries.
